/**
 * is-entrypoint.mjs: whether node was started on a given module.
 *
 * A copy of oxageninc/product's tools/scripts/lib/is-entrypoint.mjs, where
 * twenty scripts import it. The DoD scripts here import this copy.
 *
 *   if (isEntrypoint(import.meta.url)) await main();
 *
 * A check script runs its body only when node starts it, so a test can import
 * its functions without running them. The usual comparison,
 * `import.meta.url === file://${process.argv[1]}`, fails in two ways, and each
 * one makes the script exit 0 having checked nothing, so its CI step passes
 * green:
 *
 * - Node resolves symlinks in the main module's URL but not in argv[1], so a
 *   checkout reached through a symlinked directory (macOS `/tmp`, a symlinked
 *   worktree root) never matches.
 * - `import.meta.url` percent-encodes a space, `[`, or `#`, and argv[1] does
 *   not, so a checkout under such a path never matches either.
 *
 * Comparing real file paths avoids both (#4664 item 1). Every script that
 * guards its body this way should call this one helper, so the fix cannot drift
 * between copies.
