// DoD merge check (oxagen #1321) — SCR-003 enforcement.
//
// SCR-003 says an issue closes only when every definition-of-done item is
// satisfied and verified. The task issue template (SCR-003 at L2) makes the
// DoD exist; nothing yet made it *checked*. This module supplies the pure
// judgements the workflow needs:
//
//   1. Does this PR claim to close an issue, only advance one (`Refs #N`,
//      oxagen#2640), or link nothing at all?
//   2. Does the DoD checklist of each issue the PR *claims to close* have
//      any unchecked item left?
//
// A `Refs #N` reference is recorded as "this PR is not orphaned" and never
// gated on `#N`'s DoD, because it does not claim to close it — the org's own
// convention (stella/AGENTS.md, "Closing the issue on merge") is exactly
// that `Refs` "deliberately does not close".
//
// ## Why the check runs on the pull request, not on the close
//
// GitHub closes an issue the moment a PR containing `Closes #N` merges, and no
// webhook can veto that — by the time an `issues: closed` event arrives, the
// close has already happened. So verifying at close time can only ever be
// after-the-fact cleanup. Verifying on the PR inverts it: unchecked DoD boxes
// fail the required check, the merge is blocked, and the close never occurs.
// The `issues: closed` guard in the workflow is the safety net for the manual
// path (someone closing by hand), not the primary mechanism.
//
// ## Why checklist state and not an LLM
//
// A markdown task list is machine-readable — `- [x]` versus `- [ ]`. Asking a
// model whether a DoD "looks satisfied" would make a deterministic, auditable
// gate probabilistic, and would let a confident-sounding paragraph outrank an
// unticked box. Whether the human ticking the box was *honest* is not
// something either approach can check; the box is at least a recorded claim.
