// Negated closing-keyword check (oxagen #3680).
//
// GitHub's closing-keyword parser has no notion of negation. "This PR does not
// close #2972." closes #2972 when the PR merges, exactly as "Closes #2972"
// does. PR #3533 carried that sentence and closed P0 #2972 with the fix still
// unshipped.
//
// `scr-dod-check.mjs` reads the same sentence as a disclaimer and skips it,
// which is right for the DoD gate: the PR does not claim the issue, so the
// issue's checklist should not bind it. That leaves nothing that stops the
// close itself. This module fills that gap. It fails a PR whose body or commit
// messages put a negation before a closing keyword and an issue reference, and
// tells the author how to write the sentence so GitHub reads nothing in it.
//
// It also fails a second shape. An author demotes the description from
// `Closes #N` to `Refs #N` because the PR no longer finishes the issue, but a
// commit on the branch still says `Closes #N`. A squash merge copies the commit
// messages into the commit that lands on main, and GitHub closes the issue from
// there. The edited description changes nothing.
//
// The keyword pattern, the negation words, and the spans GitHub ignores come
// from `scr-dod-check.mjs`, so the two checks agree on what counts as a close.
// The negation window does not. The DoD gate reads the few words before the
// keyword, and this check reads the whole sentence (see `isNegatedInSentence`).

// a real close that shares a sentence with an unrelated negation, such as "Not
